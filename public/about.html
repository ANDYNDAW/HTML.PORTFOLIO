<h1>About Me</h1>


<p>
  My name is Amdy Ndao. I was born and raised in Senegal,
   and I now live in Italy, where I’m pursuing my passion
    for technology and software development. Moving to a 
    new country has given me a broader perspective and 
    strengthened my determination to grow both personally 
    and professionally.
  </p>
  <p>
  I’m currently studying to become a full stack developer,
   focusing on mastering both front-end and back-end 
   technologies. I’m learning to build dynamic,
    responsive web applications that not only function 
    well but also provide a great user experience. I 
    enjoy the process of problem-solving and creating
     things from the ground up-turning an idea into 
     something real through code is incredibly rewarding.
  </p>
  <p>
  My journey into coding started with curiosity and quickly
   turned into a deep interest. I’m dedicated to continuously
    improving my skills, learning from others, and staying 
    updated with the latest tools and technologies in the 
    development world.
  </p>
  <p>
  As I work toward my goals, I’m open
   to new opportunities, collaborations, and experiences that 
   will help me grow as a developer and contribute meaningfully to the
    tech community.

  <p>I speak French Italien and English </p>
